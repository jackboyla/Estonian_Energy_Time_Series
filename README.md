# Estonian Energy Price & Production Time Series Analysis

## Data Description

The energy production data was retrieved from https://transparency.entsoe.eu/ <br> 
and Nord Pool power market price data from https://dashboard.elering.ee/en/nps/price.

The dataset provided with this task contains a wealth of information about energy production and power market prices that can provide valuable insights into production trends and pricing patterns. 

Understanding the temporal patterns in energy production can help energy companies optimize their production and distribution strategies. This is beneficial for producers and consumers alike: if there is a consistent spike in demand at certain periods, companies can adjust their production schedules to meet this demand and avoid shortages or excess supply.
